A basic Todo App, built using Flutter (BLoC architecture and Hive Database).
It contains the following features : 
### 1. Adding a Todo (with date and description)
### 2. Viewing any day's Todos (selecting the date on an interactive calendar)
### 3. Deleting a todo
### 4. Updating the description of a todo
### 5. Marking/Unmarking a todo as completed


## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Run the app on the Android Studio emulator or an Android Device.
3. Choose the 'Add Todo' button to add a Todo (date and description). The todo is set as incomplete by default.
4. Select the date whose todos you want to view/change on the calendar.
5. The list of todos for the particular date is displayed, along with options to Complete it (checkbox), Delete it (Bin icon) and Update it (Pencil Icon).
6. Notifications for all todos will be displayed on the respective date at 9:00 AM (This can be customised in the source code).
7. You are allowed to add todos for all days from the present day to 30 days later. (Can be customised too)
